A python library (eventually) that should make python + serial displays much
easier on the BeagleBone (and perhaps other embedded boards).

This will probably be a rocky ride, and the Python code is going to be
horrible at first, as Python is not my strongest coding language (nor do I
really grok OOP).

If this takes off, I guess I'll supply a Phabricator instance to browse the
code and control diffs.
